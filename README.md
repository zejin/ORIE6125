# ORIE6125 Project

### Purpose

[1] Implement the thresholding estimator of quadratic functionals

[2] Apply the thresholding estimator of quadratic functionals to improve the power of the high-dimensional two-sample hypothesis testing for the means

[3] Apply the thresholding estimator of quadratic functionals to test the high-dimensional multifactor pricing models and validate the U.S. equity market inefficiency during the 2007-08 financial crisis
